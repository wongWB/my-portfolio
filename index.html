                    <li>IE4727 Web Application Design, developed a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP and integrating a MySQL database, in XAMPP. <br>
                        Worked in a 2 person team to built a functional webapp with user authentication and CRUD functionalities. The project assessment also contains planning process documentation.
                        including comining up with user requirements, wireframe, sitemap, storyboarding, basic blackbox testing plan before the implementation.
                    <br>
                    it is some "crowd sourced book library repository" where user can enter books on the platform and what the location is and the admin dashboard side can approve or reject
                    the book entry.
                    <br> yes this is a very basic webapp, made for the sake of passing a course module, but it is a good learning experience for me to learn how to use the web technologies and how to work in a team.

                        I mainly worked on optimizing the front end of the web app for responsive design, implemented dark mode, and implemented features.
                        The codebase for the front end is Javascript with React, and the endpoints is nodejs.
